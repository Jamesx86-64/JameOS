## What is JameOS ##

JameOS is a school project I created for the IB personal project.

## Why use JameOS ##

JameOS is a lightweight Linux distro that aims to be easy to use for people wanting to try linux.

## Versions ##

There are currently 2 versions of JameOS: [1.0](#jameos-10 "Go to JameOS 1.0") and [1.1](#jameos-11 "Go to JameOS 1.1").

## JameOS 1.0 ##

JameOS 1.0 is based off of [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ "Linux From Scratch").

**Some features of JameOS 1.0:**

JameOS 1.0 is command line only, and as such is super lightweight but most likely wont meet your every day needs.

**Why use JameOS 1.0?**

- Really, I have no idea.

**Issues with JameOS 1.0?**

- Currently doesnt work.
- Command line only.
- No package manager. 

## JameOS 1.1 ##

JameOS 1.1 is based off of Arch Linux.

**Some features of JameOS 1.1:**

- JameOS 1.1 can boot on systems using secure boot and is setup to be easily used in a dualboot configureation. 
- JameOS 1.1 has a fully functional desktop and should be functional for most everyday use.
- JameOS 1.1 has the ability to run some windows applications using a progam called [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/ "WineHQ").
- JameOS 1.1 has the ability to mount microsoft filesystems such as NTFS and FAT32.
- JameOS 1.1 has a graphical app installer preinstalled in order to make installing apps much simalar.

**Why use JameOS 1.1?**

- If you like the power and control of Arch Linux but the simplicity and ease of use of Manjaro.
- Staying up to date most of the time on the newest software when it is realised.
- If you want an operating system that boots straight from a usb drive and not just as an ISO that is reset when you reboot.
- If you dont like using windows.
- If you want a more performant operating system instead of windows, the performce boost is especialy noticable for older devices.

**Issues with JameOS 1.0?**

- Comes as an .img not .iso file.
- Does not have a dedicated installer and can be tedious to install to disk.
- It is quite large for a Linux system image file.
- Does not support some windows only applications, including some video games and adbobe products.
- Does not have a lot of active developers (just me).

## Which Version Should I use? ##

Most likely JameOS 1.1 as it has a desktop and is fully usable for almost anyone and on almost any device. 

## Download Link ##

## Where To Find Help? ##

Im hopefull this project can help you make the switch to Linux. 
Unfortunaty however bugs and lack of experience with new software can cause a lot of frustutarion and lead many users to quit. 
Fortunatly There are many great resources for finding help with Linux systems. 
However if you run into some trouble these are some super helpful resources to both look throught and ask questions on.

**Some of the resources I find most helpful are listed here:**

- Arch Linux Wiki
- Arch Linux Forums
- UnixStackExchange
- LinuxQuestions.org

**You can also report problems you face or help you need the in issues tab of this repository or contact me if you are someone I personaly know.**

## Upcoming Features ##

These are some other versions of JameOS I would like to release sometime in the future. 

### **JameOS 1.2** ###

**What will it be?**

- This will be a realse based off of JameOS 1.1 but will contain lots of easter eggs and inside jokes.

**When Will If Be Out?**

- When I feel like it.

### **JameOS 1.1-arm** ###

**What will it be?**

- This will be a version of JameOS that works for arm devices, such as thhe raspberry pi.

**When Will If Be Out?**

- Hopefully soon, once I get all the bugs out of the 1.1 release. 

### **JameOS.sh** ###

**What will it be?**

- It will be a script that transforms any linux system into a JameOS system and automaticaly installes JameOS on the Arch Linux installer.

**When Will If Be Out?**

- Idk, I might not ever do this.
