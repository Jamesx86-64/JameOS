- If you like the power and control of Arch Linux but the simplicity and ease of use of Manjaro.
- Staying up to date most of the time on the newest software when it is realised.
- If you want an operating system that boots straight from a usb drive and not just as an ISO that is reset when you reboot.
- If you dont like using windows.
- If you want a more performant operating system instead of windows, the performce boost is especialy noticable for older devices.

- Comes as an .img not .iso file.
- Does not have a dedicated installer and can be tedious to install to disk.
- It is quite large for a Linux system image file.

- Does not have a lot of active developers (just me).
