## What Is JameOS ##

JameOS is a school project I created for the IB personal project.

## Why Use JameOS ##

JameOS is a lightweight Linux distro that aims to be easy to use for people wanting to try linux.

## Versions ##

There are currently 2 versions of JameOS: [1.0](#jameos-10 "Go to JameOS 1.0") and [1.1](#jameos-11 "Go to JameOS 1.1").

## JameOS 1.0 ##

JameOS 1.0 is based on [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ "Linux From Scratch").

**Some features of JameOS 1.0:**

JameOS 1.0 is command line only, and as such is super lightweight but most likely won't meet your everyday needs.

**Why use JameOS 1.0?**

- Really, I have no idea.

**Disadvantages of JameOS 1.0?**

- Command line only.
- No package manager. 

**NOTE:** JameOS 1.0 has been discontinued and is currently not avalible in downloads.

## JameOS 1.1 ##

JameOS 1.1 is based off of Arch Linux.

**Some features of JameOS 1.1:**

- JameOS 1.1 can boot on systems using [secure boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot "Microsoft Docs") and is set up to be easily used in a [dual boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multi-booting "Wikipedia") configuration. 
- JameOS 1.1 has a fully functional [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/ "KDE") desktop and should be functional for most everyday use.
- JameOS 1.1 has the ability to run some windows applications using a program called [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/ "WineHQ").
- JameOS 1.1 has the ability to mount microsoft filesystems such as [NTFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/ntfs-overview "Microsoft Docs") and [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table "Wikipedia").
- JameOS 1.1 has a graphical app installer preinstalled in order to make installing apps much similar.

**Why use JameOS 1.1?**

- If you like the power and control of Arch Linux but the simplicity and ease of use of Manjaro.
- Staying up to date most of the time on the newest software when it is realized.
- If you want an operating system that boots straight from a usb drive and not just as an ISO that is reset when you reboot.
- If you don't like using windows.
- If you want a more performant operating system instead of windows, the performance boost is especially notable for older devices.

**Disadvantages of JameOS 1.1?**

- Comes as an .img not .iso file.
- Does not have a dedicated installer and can be tedious to install to disk.
- It is quite large for a Linux system image file.
- Does not support some windows only applications, including some video games and adobe products.
- Does not have a lot of active developers (just me).

## Which Version Should I Use ##

Most likely JameOS 1.1 as it has a desktop and is fully usable for almost anyone and on almost any device.

## Where To Find Help ##

I'm hopeful this project can help you make the switch to Linux. 
Unfortunately however bugs and lack of experience with new software can cause a lot of frustration and lead many users to quit. 
Fortunately There are many great resources for finding help with Linux systems. 
However if you run into some trouble these are some super helpful resources to both look through and ask questions on.

**Some of the resources I find most helpful are listed here:**

- [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/ "ArchWiki")
- [Arch Linux Forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/ "Arch Linux Forums")
- [Unix Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/ "Stack Exchange")
- [LinuxQuestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org/ "LinuxQuestions.org")

**You can also report problems you face or help you need the in issues tab of this repository or contact me if you are someone I personally know.**
